# IoT-Based Anesthesia Control and Monitoring System

This project implements a real-time **IoT-based medical monitoring and anesthesia automation system** using the **ESP8266 NodeMCU**. It monitors patient vitals such as **heart rate, SpO2, and body temperature**, displays values on an **OLED display**, and provides a mobile-responsive web UI. A servo motor activates anesthesia delivery when threshold conditions are met.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of BPM, SpO2, Temperature
- OLED display output
- Mobile-friendly web interface
- Non-blocking 10s delay logic
- Automatic anesthesia control with servo motor
- Wi-Fi enabled remote monitoring
